Welcome to the Movie project! This README provides an overview of the project, its components, and how to get started. Movie Gold allows you to explore and review your favorite movies.

## Deployment

You can access the deployed frontend of this project at the following URL:

[Frontend Deployment](https://fullstack-movieapp.netlify.app)

The frontend is hosted and available for you to explore the movie exploration and review features. Enjoy using the application and discovering your favorite movies!


## Code Explanation

The Movie project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Below, I provide a general overview of the code structure and how the project components are organized:

### Code Organization

- The `api` directory contains the Axios configuration in the `axiosConfig.js` file. This configuration is used to interact with the movie database API.

- The project's main code entry point is `App.js`, where the application structure is defined.

- Styling is done through CSS files, Bootstrap and React-Boostrap

The project's `package.json` file includes dependencies and scripts for running, building, and testing the application.

This code structure is designed to provide an organized and maintainable way to create a movie exploration and review application. It is extendable, allowing for the addition of new features and improvements as needed.

## Backend Repository

I've also developed the backend for this project using Spring Boot. If you're interested in the backend code, you can check out our dedicated repository for it.

In the backend repository, you'll find the server-side code, APIs, and database interactions that power this application. Feel free to explore the backend to see how it complements the frontend to create a complete movie exploration and review platform.
